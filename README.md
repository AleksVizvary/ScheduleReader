# Quick Guide

## 1. Install Python

Go to python.org/downloads in your browser and install Python 3.

## 2. Add your schedule (kinda specific format tho)

- Put your current Excel schedule into the TuGrafik folder.

## 3. Open the terminal

Mac: open the Terminal app

Windows: open cmd or PowerShell

## 4. Go to the project folder
``` cd Documents/Programs/ScheduleReader ```

## 5. Install the required libraries
``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

### If pip doesn’t work, run:
``` python -m pip install --upgrade pip ```

6. Run the program

Mac:
``` python3 main.py ```


Windows:
``` py main.py ```

## 7. Enter your name as in the schedule → you’ll get a .ics file. It will be in the MyCalendar folder.


# Open the .ics file on your Apple device, pick a color, add details.
# Tip: create it in a new color calendar, so you can easily remove it later if needed.
